Lines 1-6:

using System; and following lines: These lines import necessary libraries for working with files, databases, Excel documents, and handling exceptions.
Lines 8-10:

class Program and following lines: This defines a class named Program which is the entry point of the application.
Lines 12-13:

SearchTermValueModel SearchTermValueModel = new SearchTermValueModel(); - This line creates an instance of a class named SearchTermValueModel (likely a custom class to hold search terms and their values).
static int Claimid = 28; - This line declares a static integer variable Claimid and assigns it the value 28 (might be relevant for the database query).
Lines 15-58:

static void Main(string[] args) - This is the main function where the program execution begins.
Lines 17-55:

The try...catch...finally block is for error handling.
Lines 18-33:

Within the try block:
string inputExcelFilePath and string outputExcelFilePath - These lines define string variables holding file paths for the input and output excel files.
ExcelPackage.LicenseContext = LicenseContext.NonCommercial; - This line sets the license context for using the Excel package library (likely for non-commercial use).
DeleteExistingOutputFile(outputExcelFilePath); - This line calls a function to delete any existing output excel file.
string headerSqlQuery = FindHeaderSqlQuery(inputExcelFilePath); - This line calls a function to find the SQL query for retrieving data from the database (based on info in the excel file).
List<SearchTermValueModel> searchTermValueList = RetrieveDataFromDatabase(headerSqlQuery); - This line calls a function to retrieve data from the database using the retrieved SQL query and stores the results in a list of SearchTermValueModel objects.
The code then opens the input excel file using the ExcelPackage library and iterates through each worksheet within the file.
For each worksheet, the ProcessWorksheet function is called to process the data.
Finally, the modified excel package is saved to the output file path.
Lines 35-40:

Console.WriteLine("Excel file has been successfully generated."); - This line prints a success message to the console if there were no errors.
Lines 41-48:

The catch block handles any exceptions that might occur during execution and prints an error message.
Lines 49-53:

The finally block ensures some code is always executed, regardless of exceptions. Here, it prompts the user to press any key to exit the program.
Lines 56-78:

static string FindHeaderSqlQuery(string inputExcelFilePath) - This function takes the input excel file path and searches for a cell containing text starting with "#HeaderSQL=". If found, it extracts the SQL query text after removing the prefix and trims any leading/trailing spaces. It throws an exception if the header SQL query is not found.
Lines 80-104:

static void ProcessWorksheet(ExcelWorksheet worksheet, List<SearchTermValueModel> searchTermValueList) - This function takes an excel worksheet and a list of search term-value pairs. It iterates through each cell in the worksheet.
If a cell's value starts and ends with curly braces {}, it's considered a placeholder.
The content within the braces is extracted and converted to lowercase.
It searches the searchTermValueList for a matching search term (also converted to lowercase).
If a match is found, the cell value is replaced with the corresponding search value. Otherwise, a message indicating no data found for the placeholder is printed to the console.
Lines 106-138:

static List<SearchTermValueModel> RetrieveDataFromDatabase(string headerSqlQuery) - This function takes the SQL query string and retrieves data from the database.
It creates a new empty list to store search term-value pairs.
It defines a connection string containing details for connecting to the database.
It opens a connection to the database using the connection string.
It creates a SqlCommand object with the provided SQL query and sets the Claimid parameter (likely used in the query).
It executes the query and retrieves the results using
